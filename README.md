## Overview
This function is designed to be used inside other functions during development, such that errors can be tracked down and corrected.

Simply add it as a command inside the script or module are troubleshooting, right before or after the problem areas, so that the debug command can pause the execution, show you the last command that ran and let you view any on screen errors.
